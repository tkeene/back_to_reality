# back_to_reality
C# code I wrote for a Godot game made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 54. I had only been using Godot for 2 weeks, so there's a lot of fun oddities like using local-space Spatial variables when I should be using world-space ones, or the pathfinding code using three different hacks to work around some Godot 3.5 issues (couldn't use 4.0 because it doesn't support HTML5 builds).
